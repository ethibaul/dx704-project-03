My choice is UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)

Justification: Rewards are bounded, right-skewed with unequal variances and many zeros. 
UCB deals with those factors by being variance aware and simple with continuous bounded rewards. 
It also avoids the modeling assumptions required for Thompson Sampling and the potentially wasteful
overhead of Îµ-greedy
